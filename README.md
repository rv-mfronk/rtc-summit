# 2019 RTC Summit Hackathon
## OVERVIEW:
You’ve been assembled into teams consisting of members from various backgrounds and interests to attack the problem outlined below. It is your responsibility to work collectively as a team to build a strong set of deliverables, explain your product, and why you decided on this recommendation to Red Ventures leadership.
 
## BACKGROUND:
Much of Red Ventures’ technology relies on growing volume for our partners and brands through our innovative strategies. These technologies are created to optimize processes and grow audiences across all verticals. The technologies are used to target specific audiences, to drive our KPIs (key performance indicators), and to drive revenue. 

## ACTION TO COMPLETE:
Red Ventures has decided to explore the opportunity of expanding its portfolio to the Health Information industry. This venture would live within the RV Healthcare vertical. Red Ventures would be building this asset from scratch, and you will  be provided with some data from Health searches by US Metropolitan Area, 2005-2017. You and your colleagues will take this data and create a recommendation for a solution that Red Ventures should consider as we enter the Health Information space. (1) evaluate the opportunities within the data. (2) Using the data, write code to create an interesting prototype that will benefit Red Ventures. (3) evaluate benefits and risks of the product that should be taken into consideration. This can be as simple as a CLI or as complex as a full-blown website; please include what your next steps would be given that you had 6 months and 3 engineers (2 back-end, 1 front-end) and 1 product manager.
 
## EXECUTION:
You will have two hours to create an outline of the Health Information product you wish demo. Run an initial brainstorm and feedback session of your opportunities and return to your coach a preliminary recommendation of solution to use.  
Once you discuss your decision with your coach, you will need to work again with the team members to address the following question: How can you design and implement the product recommendation that you have created to generate the most efficiency within the industry? 

### Suggested Timeline: 
- *Monday*: Brainstorm and create the outline for the hackathon
- *Tuesday*: implementation of product and creating presentation
- *Wednesday*: Add final touches to demo.

 
## DELIVERABLES:
Each team will be responsible for a demo that will be delivered to Red Ventures Leadership and should include, but is not limited to:
1. Your proof of concept of a technological solution.

   Be sure to take into consideration privacy or legal concerns, economic development and stability, ethical issues, scalability across markets, and any other relevant technology trends.
2. A roll-out plan for the integration of your solution, as well as a demonstration of your tech solution.
3. A 6-month timeline for the design and implementation of your solution in the Health Information market.
    - What programming languages/tech applications would you use?
    - What tech improvements will be most important?  What’s realistic?
4. With this solution created, how would success of your solution be measured?

You will have 15 minutes to deliver your presentation to our leadership team, with another 5 minutes allotted for Q&A. Each team has been provided with a tech coach who can be reached while on-site at any time or by traditional communication methods (phone calls, emails,slack) once off-site to assist you as you work on this case.
